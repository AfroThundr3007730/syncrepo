# How to Contribute

Note that I am not a code guru, I make plenty of mistakes. So if
you've found some - and would like to report them or submit a fix -
feel free to do so by [opening an issue][1] or pull request.
Feature additions or requests are also welcome here.

For bug reports, feature requests, and questions, open as an issue,
and I will take a look.

For pull requests, features should be submitted to the `dev` branch,
while a bug fix gets pushed to `master` or the relevant release branch.
