How to Contribute
=================

Note that I am not a code guru, I make plenty of mistakes. So if you've found some - and would like to report them or submit a fix - feel free to do so by opening an issue or pull request. Feature additions or requests are also welcome here.

For bug reports, feature requests, and questions, open as an issue, and I will take a look.

For pull requests, features should be submitted to the `dev` branch, while a bug fix gets pushed to `master` or the relevant release branch.
