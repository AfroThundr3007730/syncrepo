# Security Policy

This project will make an effort to keep on top of issues and bug reports,
especially those with security implications.

## Supported Versions

Generally speaking, the last two minor releases will be supported. Anything
older than that should be migrated to a supported version. Bugs found in a
non-supported version should only be reported if they persist in a supported
version of the code.

| Version | Supported          | Date Released |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| 1.8.x   | :white_check_mark: | TBD (Q2 2024) |
| 1.7.x   | :white_check_mark: | 2024-03-01    |
| 1.6.x   | :x:                | 2018-10-29    |
| < 1.6   | :x:                | N/A           |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This repository uses GitHub's built-in [workflow] for reporting security issues,
which allows for private reporting.

To report a security issue, browse to the repository page, click the
**Security** tab, then the **Report a Vulnerability** button (or just click
here: [report]). Then fill in the relevant details and submit the report. The
issue will be reviewed and handled accordingly.
