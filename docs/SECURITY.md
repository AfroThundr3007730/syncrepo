## Reporting a Vulnerability

This repository uses GitHub's [built-in workflow][reporting] for reporting
security issues. This workflow allows for private reporting.

To report a security issue, browse to the repository page, click the
**Security** tab, then the **Report a Vulnerability** button (or just click
[here][report]). Then fill in the relevant details and submit the report.

The issue will be reviewed and handled accordingly.
