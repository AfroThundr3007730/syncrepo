# How to Contribute

Note that the author is not a codeing expert, and makes plenty of mistakes. If
you've found one - and would like to report it or submit a fix - feel free to do
so by opening an [issue] or pull request. Feature additions or requests are also
welcome here.

For bug reports and feature requests, open an issue and provide any relevant
details there. Questions are not well suited to issue format, and may be better
addressed by asking instead on [Gitter].

For pull requests, features and bug fixes should be submitted to the `dev`
branch. Bug fixes will also get pushed to `master` or the relevant release
branch when needed. Code submissions should be [lint] free, and follow best
practices where possible.
